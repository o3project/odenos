What's ODENOS
==========================
ODENOS is a network orchestration framework for controlling
multi-layer, multi-domain or multi-vendor networks.

ODENOS enables programmers to easily design a SDN orchestrator

Driver, Operator and Application.

Currently, some examples which use OpenFlowDriver and Mininet
